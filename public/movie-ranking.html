<h1> The Best Movies according to Dominic!!!</h1>
<h2> My Top Movies of All Time!!! :) </h2>
<hr /> 

<h3>Shutter island</h3>
<p> The movie has many twists and turns that makes you feel like you've been taken for a ride</p>

<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>It allowed me to get closure on a lot of the characters and how they defeated Thanos who took everything from them</p>

<h3>Pineapple Express</h3>
<p>Has one of my favourite characters who shows how he doesnt have life figured out but just gets himself into the strangest situations</p>
